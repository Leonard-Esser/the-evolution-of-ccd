# The Evolution of CCD

data/input/frames/2c90883 contains two data frames. The "focused" version is simply a filter where only selected columns are shown. The main data frame is a flattened set of events and how these events where classified by another program. An event is a basically a change to a file – a change to either a README or a CONTRIBUTING file in one of 385 randomly selected OSS projects hosted on GitHub.

- For the program that classified the data, go to the repository Leonard-Esser/autumn-2025.
- TODO document the parameters used for the data collection
